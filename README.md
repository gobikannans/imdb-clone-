Create a IMDB.com like website with basic CRUD and movie listing using Node.js. We 
would like to have the following entities in the application. Using IMDB API is a bonus.
Relationships
● Actor can act in multiple movies.
● Movie can have multiple actors.
● Movie has only one producer.
● Producer can produce multiple movies.
Application specifics (minimum requirements)
• Screen to list all movies with Name, Year of release, Producer and all Actors of that 
movie.
• Screen to ‘add’ a new movie with the necessary fields with existing actors and 
producers. If the user wants to add new ‘Actors’ and ‘Producers’ while creating 
the movie which are not present in the database, then he should be able to do so 
while being on the same screen.
• ‘Listing’ screen should allow user to click on ‘Edit’ and edit all the details of the 
movie and save it would be a nice to do thing.
• Use Redux/ MobX for State Management.
Hints and Tips
• Focus on database design; we are fanatic about Normal Forms.
• We are always on the lookout for best practices. Design/Styling/CSS is not critical; 
functionality is.
• Define your own rules for validation; use common sense - also please make a note 
of the validations that you have added.
• Use of upcoming JS frameworks like Knockout / Vue / React / Angular to surprise us.
Bonus
• Usage of React Hooks.
• IMDB API.
• Token based authentication.
• Not borrowing many Node Modules and React Components
